# Licenses

The PiDP-8/I software distribution is an agglomeration of software from
multiple sources.  Consequently, it is distributed under several
different licenses.  This file acts as a guide to those licenses.


## SIMH License

Most of the files in this software distribution are released under the
terms of the SIMH license, a copy of which appears at the top of each
file it applies to.

For a few files, this license is applied by reference, rather than
inclusion, so a copy of the license is also [given separately][sl].

## autosetup License

The `configure` script and the contents of the `autosetup` directory are
released under the FreeBSD license given in [`autosetup/LICENSE`][as].

## OS/8 License

The OS/8 media images included with this software distribution are
released under the Digital License Agreement presented in
[`media/os8/LICENSE.md`][dla].

The other files in the [`media` directory][md] that originate from
Digital Equipment Corporation are believed to fall under the "[hobbyist
license][dhl]" that OpenVMS was released under.  Documentation proving
this is still wanted, however.
