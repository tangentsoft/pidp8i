# Bootable Systems:

`os8.tu56` Bootable OS/8 Dectape image suitable for experimentation.

`os8.rk05` The OS/8 rk05 pack you should boot and use.  Built from the `os8v3d-bin.rk05` baseline below plus additional stuff. (To be docmented somewhere soon.)

# Other:

`LICENSE.md`	License provided by DEC that makes our use OS/8 legal.

# Baseline disk images:

`os8v3d-bin.rk05`	OS/8 Bootable Binary distribution baseline system made from the binary Dectapes of OS/8 V3D in the Willem van der Mark Archives.

`os8v3d-src.rk05`	OS/8 Source RK05 pack made from the source Dectapes of OS/8 V3D in the Willem van der Mark Archives. 

# Willem van der Mark Archives:

Willem van der Mark wrote a really cool [PDP-8 emulator in Java](http://vandermark.ch/pdp8/index.php).  He has a well organized archive of DEC media.  The following Dectapes were copied from his [OS8-V3D software archive](http://vandermark.ch/pdp8/index.php?n=OS8.OS8-V3D).

The OS/8 Binary Dectapes were compared against those in [Dave Gesswein's Archive](http://www.pdp8online.com/images/images/misc_dectapes.shtml) and found to be nearly identical.  Of the three tapes reviewed, a total of 2 words differed. Further comparison is possible as a project for an interested person.
