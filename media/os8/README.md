# Bootable Systems

`os8.tu56` Bootable OS/8 DECtape image suitable for experimentation.

`os8.rk05` The OS/8 RK05 pack you should boot and use.  Built from the
`os8v3d-bin.rk05` baseline below plus additional stuff.  (To be
docmented somewhere soon.)


# Baseline Disk Images

`os8v3d-bin.rk05`   OS/8 Bootable Binary distribution baseline system
made from the binary DECtapes of OS/8 V3D in the Willem van der Mark
Archives.

`os8v3d-src.rk05`   OS/8 Source RK05 pack made from the source DECtapes
of OS/8 V3D in the Willem van der Mark Archives.

# Willem van der Mark Archives

Willem van der Mark wrote a really cool [PDP-8 emulator in Java][vdms].
He has a well organized archive of DEC media.  The following DECtapes
were copied from his [OS8-V3D software archive][vdms].

The OS/8 Binary DECtapes were compared against those in [Dave Gesswein's
Archive][dga] and found to be nearly identical.  Of the three tapes
reviewed, a total of 2 words differed. Further comparison is possible as
a project for an interested person.
