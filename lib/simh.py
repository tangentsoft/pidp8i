  # Constant used by os8_kbd_delay, assembled in stages:
  #
  # 1. PDP-8 RS-232 bits per character: 7-bit ASCII plus necessary
  #    start, stop, and parity bits.
  #
  # 2. The ratio of the instructions per second ratios of a PDP-8/I to
  #    that of the host hardware running the simulator.  The former is
  #    an approximate value; see lib/pidp8i/ips.py.in for the value and
  #    its defense.  The latter is either the IPS rate for:
  #
  #    a) a Raspberry Pi Model B+, that being the slowest host system
  #       we run this simulator on; or
  #
  #    b) the IPS rate of the actual host hardware if you have run the
  #       "bin/teco-pi-demo -b" benchmark on it.
  #
  # 2. The fact that real PDP-8s ran OS/8 reliably at 300 bps, and have
  #    been claimed to get flaky as early as 600 bps by some.  (Others
  #    claim to have run them up to 9,600 bps.)
  #
  # 3. The "safe BPS" value is the fastest bit per second speed actual
  #    PDP-8 hardware was known to run OS/8 terminal I/O at.  In this
  #    case, it is the high-speed tape reader.
  #
  #    TODO: We may be able to increase this.
  #
  #    We have one report that OS/8 was tested with terminals up to
  #    about ~600 bps before becoming unreliable.
  #
  #    We have another report that OS/8 could run under ETOS with
  #    9,600 bps terminals, but we don't know if that tells us anything
  #    about OS/8 running without the ETOS multitasking hardware.
  #
  # 4. Given above, calculate safe characters per second for host HW.
  #
  # 5. Invert to get seconds per character, that being the delay value.

  #
  # A previous version of this routine attempted to detect when
  # OS/8 was suspended, and we were in the SIMH context.
  # Unfortunately, re-synchronizing OS/8 with python expect requires
  # provoking an additional prompt.
  #
  # Although it would be expected that sending a character delete
  # or line delete would provoke a prompt, this does not work.
  # At the Keyboard Monitor command level, pausing after sending
  # the SIMH 'continue' command, then sending ^C, then pausing again
  # then sending \n\r does provoke a command prompt.
  # However, if you had escaped to SIMH from inside another program,
  # that command sequence would kill your program and return you to
  # the OS/8 keyboard monitor.
  #
  # Therefore, os8_send_cmd requires you to be running OS/8, and does

  # To resume OS/8 from SIMH we need to provoke a prompt.
  # Typing a rubout or ^U at a SIMH terminal session does this.
  # But not when SIMH is run under python expect.
  # We don't know why.
  #
  # boot works
  # go 7600 works

  #
  # Currently we do this by calling the OS/8 command entry point, which
  # has the virtue that it forces another . prompt, which keeps the
  # send/expect sequencing simple when switching between OS/8 and SIMH
  # command modes.
  #
  # That is why we don't use "cont" here instead: it requires that the
  # caller always be aware of when the . prompt went out; complicated.
  #
  # Another simple alternative is "boot rk0", which actually benchmarks
  # a smidge faster here.  We choose this method instead because we
  # expect that some of our callers will want to do several different
