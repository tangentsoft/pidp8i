  # Constant used by os8_kbd_delay, assembled in stages:
  #
  # 1. PDP-8 RS-232 bits per character: 7-bit ASCII plus necessary
  #    start, stop, and parity bits.
  #
  # 2. The ratio of the instructions per second ratios of a PDP-8/I to
  #    that of the host hardware running the simulator.  The former is
  #    an approximate value; see lib/pidp8i/ips.py.in for the value and
  #    its defense.  The latter is either the IPS rate for:
  #
  #    a) a Raspberry Pi Model B+, that being the slowest host system
  #       we run this simulator on; or
  #
  #    b) the IPS rate of the actual host hardware if you have run the
  #       "bin/teco-pi-demo -b" benchmark on it.
  #
  # 2. The fact that real PDP-8s ran OS/8 reliably at 300 bps, and have
  #    been claimed to get flaky as early as 600 bps by some.  (Others
  #    claim to have run them up to 9,600 bps.)
  #
  # 3. The "safe BPS" value is the fastest bit per second speed actual
  #    PDP-8 hardware was known to run OS/8 terminal I/O at.  In this
  #    case, it is the high-speed tape reader.
  #
  #    TODO: We may be able to increase this.
  #
  #    We have one report that OS/8 was tested with terminals up to
  #    about ~600 bps before becoming unreliable.
  #
  #    We have another report that OS/8 could run under ETOS with
  #    9,600 bps terminals, but we don't know if that tells us anything
  #    about OS/8 running without the ETOS multitasking hardware.
  #
  # 4. Given above, calculate safe characters per second for host HW.
  #
  # 5. Invert to get seconds per character, that being the delay value.

  # The first parameter must be given as the parent of bin/pidp8i-sim.

  # GPIO for the caller's exclusive use is a fatal error.  If you pass
  # True instead, we just complain if the GPIO is already locked and

  # the simulator alone, not actually the PiDP-8/I front panel display.

  #### back_to_cmd ######################################################

  # down at the SIMH layer instead.

  #### os8_kbd_delay ###################################################
  # Artificially delay the media generation process to account for the
  # fact that OS/8 lacks a modern multi-character keyboard input buffer.
  # It is unsafe to send text faster than a contemporary terminal could,
  # though we can scale it based on how much faster this host is than a
  # real PDP-8.  See the constants above for the calculation.

  #### os8_send_cmd ####################################################
  # Wait for an OS/8 command prompt running within SIMH, then send the
  # given line.
  #
  # The prompt string is passed in because OS/8 has several different
  # prompt types.

  def os8_send_cmd (self, prompt, line):
    self._child.expect ("\n%s$" % prompt)
    self.os8_send_line (line)


  #### os8_send_ctrl ###################################################
  # Send a control character to OS/8 corresponding to the ASCII letter
  # given.  We precede it with the OS/8 keyboard delay, since we're
  # probably following a call to os8_send_line or os8_send_cmd.

  def os8_send_ctrl (self, char):
    self.os8_kbd_delay ()
    self._child.sendcontrol (char[0].lower ())


  #### os8_send_file ###################################################
  # Send a copy of a local text file to OS/8.  The local path may
  # contain directory components, but the remote must not, of course.
  #
  # If the destination file name is not uppercase, it will be so forced.
  #
  # If the destination file name is not given, it is taken as the
  # basename of the source file name.

  # "blind" to OS/8, without expecting a prompt, as when driving EDIT.

    self.os8_send_str (line)

  #### os8_send_str ########################################################

  #### os8_restart #######################################################
  # Called while in the SIMH command prompt, this restarts OS/8.
  #
  # This one-line function exists to abstract the method we use and to
  # document the reason we do it this way.
  #
  # Currently we do this by calling the OS/8 command entry point, which
  # has the virtue that it forces another . prompt, which keeps the
  # send/expect sequencing simple when switching between OS/8 and SIMH
  # command modes.
  #
  # That is why we don't use "cont" here instead: it requires that the
  # caller always be aware of when the . prompt went out; complicated.
  #
  # Another simple alternative is "boot rk0", which actually benchmarks
  # a smidge faster here.  We choose this method instead because we
  # expect that some of our callers will want to do several different
  # things in a single OS/8 session, which rebooting would screw up.

  def os8_restart (self):

  # timeout value.  If no value is given, lets child run indefinitely.
