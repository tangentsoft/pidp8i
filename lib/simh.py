  # Constant used by os8_kbd_delay, assembled in stages:
  #
  # 1. PDP-8 RS-232 bits per character: 7-bit ASCII plus necessary
  #    start, stop, and parity bits.
  #
  # 2. The ratio of the instructions per second ratios of a PDP-8/I to
  #    that of the host hardware running the simulator.  The former is
  #    an approximate value; see lib/pidp8i/ips.py.in for the value and
  #    its defense.  The latter is either the IPS rate for:
  #
  #    a) a Raspberry Pi Model B+, that being the slowest host system
  #       we run this simulator on; or
  #
  #    b) the IPS rate of the actual host hardware if you have run the
  #       "bin/teco-pi-demo -b" benchmark on it.
  #
  # 2. The fact that real PDP-8s ran OS/8 reliably at 300 bps, and have
  #    been claimed to get flaky as early as 600 bps by some.  (Others
  #    claim to have run them up to 9,600 bps.)
  #
  # 3. The "safe BPS" value is the fastest bit per second speed actual
  #    PDP-8 hardware was known to run OS/8 terminal I/O at.  In this
  #    case, it is the high-speed tape reader.
  #
  #    TODO: We may be able to increase this.
  #
  #    We have one report that OS/8 was tested with terminals up to
  #    about ~600 bps before becoming unreliable.
  #
  #    We have another report that OS/8 could run under ETOS with
  #    9,600 bps terminals, but we don't know if that tells us anything
  #    about OS/8 running without the ETOS multitasking hardware.
  #
  # 4. Given above, calculate safe characters per second for host HW.
  #
  # 5. Invert to get seconds per character, that being the delay value.

  # send/expect sequencing simple when switching between OS/8 and SIMH
  # command modes.
  #
  # That is why we don't use "cont" here instead: it requires that the
  # caller always be aware of when the . prompt went out; complicated.

  # Another simple alternative is "boot rk0", which actually benchmarks
  # a smidge faster here.  We choose this method instead because we
