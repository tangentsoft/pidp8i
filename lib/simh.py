  def __init__ (self, basedir):
    # Start the simulator instance
    self._child = pexpect.spawn(basedir + '/bin/pidp8i-sim')

  #### back_to_cmd ######################################################
  # Pause the simulation and return to the SIMH command prompt when the
  # simulated software emits the given prompt string.  Typically used to
  # wait for OS/8 to finish running a command so we can do something
  # down at the SIMH layer instead.

  def back_to_cmd (self, prompt):
    self._child.expect("\n%s$" % prompt)
    self.os8_kbd_delay()
    self._child.sendcontrol('e')


  #### os8_kbd_delay ###################################################
  # Artificially delay the media generation process to account for the
  # fact that OS/8 lacks a modern multi-character keyboard input buffer.
  # It is unsafe to send text faster than a contemporary terminal could.
  #
  # The constant is based on advice we received that OS/8 would begin to
  # become unreliable when run with a terminal speaking more than about
  # 600 bps.  We divide that by 7-bit ASCII plus necessary start, stop,
  # and parity bits to get characters per second.  Then we multiply that
  # by 4, the minimum number of times faster our SIMH instance runs as
  # compared to a real PDP-8.  (Keep in mind that we initially run the
  # simulator without any throttling.)  Finally, we invert that value to
  # get secs per character instead of characters per second.  OS/8 must
  # be able to accept input at least this fast on our simulator.

  # given line.
  #
  # The prompt string is passed in because OS/8 has several different
  # prompt types.

    self._child.expect ("\n%s$" % prompt)
    self.os8_send_line (send_line)


  #### os8_send_ctrl #####################################################
  # Send a control character to OS/8 corresponding to the ASCII letter
  # given.  We precede it with the OS/8 keyboard delay, since we're
  # probably following a call to os8_send_line or os8_send_cmd.

  def os8_send_ctrl (self, char):
    self.os8_kbd_delay ()
    self._child.sendcontrol (char[0].lower ())


  #### os8_send_line #####################################################
  # Core of os8_send_cmd.  Also used by code that needs to send text
  # "blind" to OS/8, without expecting a prompt, as when driving EDIT.

  def os8_send_line (self, send_line):
    for i in xrange(0, len (send_line)):
      self._child.send (send_line[i])
      self.os8_kbd_delay ()
    self._child.send ("\r")


  #### os8_restart #######################################################
  # Called while in the SIMH command prompt, this restarts OS/8.
  #
  # This one-line function exists to abstract the method we use and to
  # document the reason we do it this way.
  #
  # Currently we do this by calling the OS/8 command entry point, which
  # has the virtue that it forces another . prompt, which keeps the
  # send/expect sequencing simple when switching between OS/8 and SIMH
  # command modes.
  #
  # That is why we don't use "cont" here instead: it requires that the
  # caller always be aware of when the . prompt went out; complicated.
  #
  # Another simple alternative is "boot rk0", which actually benchmarks
  # a smidge faster here.  We choose this method instead because we
  # expect that some of our callers will want to do several different
  # things in a single OS/8 session, which rebooting would screw up.

  def os8_restart (self):
    self.send_cmd ("go 7600")


  #### os8_squish ########################################################
  # Wraps the OS/8 SQUISH command for a given device.

  def os8_squish (self, device):
    self.os8_send_cmd ("\.", "SQUISH " + device + ":")

  #### quit ############################################################
  # Quits the simulator and waits for it to exit

  def quit (self):

  #### send_cmd ########################################################
  # Wait for a SIMH command prompt and then send the given command
