# This file is a .in file purely to provide the default version of
# ips.py which can be appended to by running bin/teco-pi-demo -b on
# the target hardware to provide a better local IPS value.

# This default is based on one fact and two assumptions:
#
# 1. The core cycle time of a PDP-8/I is 1.5 µs; this is the fact.
#
# 2. The average number of cycles per instruction is 2; some PDP-@8
#    instructions take more cycles than this, some less, and we're
#    guessing they average out to about this in real-world PDP-8 code.
#
# 3. A Raspberry Pi B+ executing pidp8i-sim executes instructions about
#    4 times faster than a PDP-8/I when the simulator is unthrottled.
#    That being the slowest Pi we must support, this gives us the lowest
#    possible IPS value short of throttling the sim, underclocking the
#    Pi, or starving the simulator of CPU power.
baseline = 333333 * 4

# Initial value; teco-pi-demo -b appends overrides for this
