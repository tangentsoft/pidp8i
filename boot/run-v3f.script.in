; Loads OS/8 V3F from DECtape, as opposed to the RK05 based environment
; in 0.script.  Based on 3.script.in, which differs by being conditional
; based on whether the user chooses at configure time whether to boot
; OS/8 V3F or V3D.  This script also runs the tape image from the build
; directory, rather than from the installation directory, since it's
; normally run as "make run-v3f".
