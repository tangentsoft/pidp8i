# FOCAL69

Significant work to recover original codeline and lore by Charles Lasner (cjl)

# Manifest

 * `DEC-08-AJAD-D.pdf` has been certfied by cjl as the definitive FOCAL 69 manual.
   This in spie of its front cover saying it is FOCAL-8. Apparently FOCAL-8 was
   a product based on FOCAL-69 that had some changes of dubious value.
 
 * `overlays` contains overlays to add features to FOCAL69.

# Assembling

    PAL8 FOCAL.BN<FOCAL.ZM,FLOAT.ZM
    LOAD FOCAL.BN
    SAVE SYS FOCAL.SV

Keep FOCAL.BN for use with overlays.
