BASIC Games and Demos

These demos in BASIC can be found in the OS/8 RK05 system packs in the `RKB0:` partition.

Many of them were ported to OS/8 BASIC by DEC employee Kay R. Fisher.  Most were published in the DEC publication,
*101 BASIC Computer Games*. That book describes itself as follows:

>It is the first collection of games all in BASIC. It is also the only collection that contains both a complete listing and
a sample run of each game along with a descriptive write-up.

The first printing was in 1973.  A quite readable preserved version of the 1975 edition can be [found online][book].
If a demo is from this book, it is designated `-101-` instead of `-----` below.  If the demo is from the book,
there will be a page or two of useful lore, and a sample run is provided.

## Usage

### <a id="calndr"></a>`CALNDR.BA`
You must modify line 160 to name the day of the week for January 1 of your year.  (0 for Sunday, -1 for Monday, etc.).
You also need to modify lines 360 and 620 for leap years:
Change the number 365 on line 360 to 366, and change the third element of the array in line 620 from 28 to 29.

### <a id="signs"></a>`SIGNS.BA`

When tested the under OS/8 BASIC we get `SU  AT LINE 00261` which is a Subscript out of Bounds error.

## History

### <a id="king"></a>`KING.BA`

Missing a bit of the text output in the game published in the 1975 edition of *101 BASIC Computer Games*,
but functionally equivalent.

### <a id="life2"></a>`LIFE2.BA`

Written by Brian Wyvill, Bradford University, Bradford, Yorkshire, England.

### <a id="mon"></a>`MONPLY.BA`

Ported to OS/8 BASIC by Kay R. Fisher who eliminated the original RSTS-E virtual files.

### <a id="poker"></a>`POKER.BA`

Original author: A. Christopher Hall, Trinity College, Hartford, CT. Re-ported to OS/8 BASIC from
[CPM Users Group POKER.BAS][cpm-src] source by Bill Cattey fixing constructs OS/8 BASIC didn't like.

### <a id="rocket"></a>`ROCKET.BA`

Ported from Focal by David Ahl, Digital. Lost for a while due to bad disk bits.
Using a partial copy from [Dave Gesswein's archive][dgw-rocket], a RSTS-11 version
was found at [pdp-11.trailing-edge.com][trailing-edge] and re-ported to OS/8 by Bill Cattey, 
converting RSTS BASIC constructs to OS/8 constructs, and eliminating ON ERROR GOTO that does
not exist in OS/8. This code diverged significantly from the version appearing in *101 BASIC
Computer Games*, but is functionally equivalent.

### <a id="rockt1"></a>`ROCKT1.BA`

Thought lost.  Recovered from [Dave Gesswein's Archive][dgw-rockt1].

### <a id="roulet"></a>`ROULET.BA`

Converted to BASIC-PLUS by David Ahl, Digital.  Ported to OS/8 BASIC By Kay R. Fisher, DEC.  Thought lost.
Recovered from [Dave Gesswein's Archive][dgw-roulet].

### <a id="tictac"></a>`TICTAC.BA`

Thought lost.  Recovered from [Dave Gesswein's Archive][dgw-tictac].

### <a id="war"></a>`WAR.BA`

Was thought lost.  Recovered from [Dave Gesswein's Archive](). However, that port to OS/8
BASIC contained a bug and could never run.  Line 230 defines the array for the cards.
In OS/8 BASIC the maximum string size needed to be specified, as well as the number of strings.
`230 DIM A$(52,3),L(54)` will not accomodate the 10-value card.  The 3 needed to be a 4. 
Program fixed and run-tested.

### <a id="war2"></a>`WAR2.BA`

Written by Bob Dores, Milton, MA. 

### <a id="wekday"></a>`WEKDAY.BA`

Written by Tom Kloos, Oregon Museum of Science and 'Industry.
