**[Bill Silver](mailto:bsilver@tidewater.net)** created E8, an
Emacs-like editor for the PDP-8.  He posted the first version
[to the PiDP-8/I mailing list][v0] on 2020.04.05; it is tagged “v0” in
[its separate Fossil repository][repo].  The subsequent 8 versions
posted to the mailing list are also checked into that repo, tagged with
their version numbers and posting timestamps.

Warren Young converted Bill Silver’s original PDF user manual to
Markdown, making some improvements to the manual along the way.  That
version is automatically converted to [a new PDF manual][pdf] on
demand after the Markdown version is updated.

From v9 onward, all E8 development occurred on the Fossil repository.
The copy presented here is [automatically merged in][up] from that repo.
