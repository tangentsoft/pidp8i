# test-mkos8 - Collects the set of all --*-os8-* options from the
#   configure script, generates all unique subsets of that option set,
#   runs configure with each of those subsets, and compares the output
#   OS/8 bin RK05 disk to the previous run's version.  If there is a
#   discrepancy, generate a diff against the build log for that option
#   set and report the problem for the user to diagnose.
#
#   The first time the script is run, or the first time a new unique
#   option subset is generated, we save the build results as the
#   exemplar to use in later tests.
